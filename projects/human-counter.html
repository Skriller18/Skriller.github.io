    <h1>Human Counter Using Supervision Project</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project focuses on developing a computer vision system for counting the number of people in a designated area using advanced technologies and algorithms.</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Real-time detection using YOLOX model</li>
        <li>Integration of polygon zones for specific area monitoring</li>
        <li>Tracking capabilities with ByteTrack</li>
        <li>Utilization of CUDA for enhanced performance</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The Human Counter system utilizes a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately detect and count individuals in a specified area. The YOLOX model processes the video feeds and applies tracking algorithms to maintain an accurate count.</p>
    <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ONNX Runtime for efficient model inference</li>
        <li>OpenCV for image processing and video capture</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>The system is designed to operate efficiently in real-time environments, leveraging the power of YOLOX for detection and ByteTrack for maintaining object identities between frames.</p>
    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>This technology can be effectively utilized for retail occupancy monitoring, helping businesses understand customer flow and optimize space utilization.</p>
